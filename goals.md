# Weight tracker project

> From programming to software development


Weight tracker should help you to track your weight by measuring amount of eaten food.

About (wide):

- add your food eaten a day (calories, mass)
- calories are saved in the custom user calories table
- add your body weight every day
- friendly/minimalistic interfaces
- generate graphs based on 
- set limits
- food and body
- limit to 1 user, no user to user communications/interfaces
- raw/rough User interfaces (plain HTML elements and little bit of bootstrap styling)
- rough website design
- strong website functionality and logic
- everyday oriented tracking + abilities to list history by the week or month
- day food sections/zones (breakfast, second breakfast, dinner, lunch, supper)
